# Unsupervised_Anomaly_Detection_Project
Project in which I perform unsupervised anomaly detection with various ML approaches. Project is created to (1) introduce myself to anomaly detection on time-series data, and (2) act as a work sample for NREL during my interview on 10/5/2022. 

Data comes from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/numenta/NAB/master/data/realKnownCause/machine_temperature_system_failure.csv.
